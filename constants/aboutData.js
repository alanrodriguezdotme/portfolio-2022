  bio: "I went to school for Graphic Design. Started my career as a Visual Designer. Eventually began doing more UX and Interaction Design. Then I started buliding my own prototypes and found myself in a UX Engineer role. My current role on Microsoft Office fuses all of those roles into one, with a focus on building robust prototypes for exploration and user tesing, and as a tool for partnering across the company and beyond.",
