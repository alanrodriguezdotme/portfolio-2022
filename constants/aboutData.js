  bio: "I'm curious to a fault, or at least I used to think so. Now I see it as one of my biggest strengths. It's what took me from studying graphic design and illustration to building robust React applications, modelling and prototyping 3D hardware, and building AI-powered music production software. Curiosity gives me range and the versatility to make an impact in all parts of the design process.",
